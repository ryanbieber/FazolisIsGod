# FazolisIsGod

The whole idea of this app is to tell the user how far they are away from Fazoils in Rochester, MN by using `ggmap()` and plotting a line between them and fazoils on said map.

It is my first app and more of a joke between my friends and I since they I compare everything relative to Fazoils. Now I can tell my poistion relative to fazoils anywhere in the US. Hahahah.
